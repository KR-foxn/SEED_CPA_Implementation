CPA(Correlation Power Analysis)

  -Power analysis attacks consume power/electromagnetic waves depending on data values and computational code values calculated inside the equipment, and generally rely on Hamming weights of data to consume power/electromagnetic waves.

  -CPA is a method of guessing the key by obtaining the correlation coefficient.

  -Power consumption is proportional to the number of 1 intermediate values in the operation.

  - If the key guess is correct, the correlation coefficient is high.
